## Week 2 (W37) – 09.09 – 15.09 - Understand your data and your modelling goal
<p> In this week, you will be getting familiar with the data. At the end of the week, the goal is to have clean data, efficiently imported into your workspace, and visualized, and to understand what the data is used for. The PDF you will return will have max. 2 pages.

Breakdown of the points:

0.25p   – an established communication channel and appropriate strategy for code sharing.<br>
0.25p   – data correctly imported into appropriate matrices completely: observations as rows, variables (predictors) as columns.<br>
0.5p     – identification of challenges of the data: for example: time series not synchronized, missing values in data, extra variables, variables with unknown physical meanings, etc.<br>
0.5p     – a visualization and comment on the dataset: variable distribution, number of observations, type of measurements (time series or not time series)<br>
0.5p     – identification of pretreatment steps, and a plan on how to do data pretreatment </p>

## Week 3 (W38) – 16.09 – 22.09 – Data pretreatment
Based on your initial evaluation, the received feedback and the strategies of other groups, perform data pretreatment. There will be a max. 2 pages addition to your project PDF.

Breakdown of the points:

0.25p   - feedback incorporation and adjustment of the initial pretreatment plan<br>
0.25p    - division of data into calibration, validation and test partitions<br>
0.5p     - data centering and scaling techniques<br>
0.5p     - evaluation of extreme/ missing values and mitigating actions, data synchronization (for time series), sampling<br>
0.5p      - visualizing pretreated data<br>

## Week 4 (W39) – 23.09 – 29.09 – Modelling plan
Make a modelling plan for your modelling goal. Create a flowchart of the operations needed to accomplish the task, and assign roles to the team members for each step. The start of each flow chart should be the cleaned data, and the end of it should be the modelling goal achieved. If there is more than one modelling goal, the flowchart can take multiple paths. There will be a max. 2 pages addition to your project PDF. There will be a max. 2 pages addition to your project PDF.

0.5p     - modelling goal (What is the purpose of your data analysis?);<br>
0.5p     - model calibration strategy: tools used, methodology, data used;<br>
0.5p     - model validation strategy: scope of validation, methodology;<br>
0.5p     - model testing strategy: metrics and data used;<br>
0.5p     - description of the mathematical methods used in modelling;<br>
0.5p     - model diagram/ operations flowchart;<br>
0.5p     - role of group members in modelling;<br>
0.5p     - document appearance: readability, figures and captures, clarity and completeness.<br>

## Week 5 (W40) – 30.09 – 06.10 – Feedback for the model
You will leave feedback to other teams’ strategies. The number of comments you leave is equal to the number of team members in the group. You can choose to post individually (each group member leaves one comment) or as a group (one person comments each group, with a comment commonly formulated by the whole team).

Positivity is highly encouraged, but you need to help the other team improve their submissions. Some examples of what you can comment:

Point out possible mistakes;<br>
Say what you did not understand, or what can be said clearer;<br>
If you have methodology suggestions that can bring improvements to the submissions;<br>
If you have decided to do things differently than the group you are commenting to, you can point out alternative ways to do things.<br>
You do not need to have the same dataset as the groups you are commenting to.

## Week 6 (W41) – 07.10 – 13.10 – Initial model results
Points breakdown:

0.5p     - feedback incorporation<br>
1p        - code (correctness, efficiency, usability)<br>
0.5p     - reporting (readability, completeness, presentation)<br>
1p        - modelling correctness<br>
1p        - achieving the modelling goal<br>
For A-level teams: 3p        - difficulty

## Week 7 (W42) – 14.10 – 20.10 – Feedback
You will leave feedback to other teams’ strategies. The number of comments you leave is equal to the number of team members in the group. You can choose to post individually (each group member leaves one comment) or as a group (one person comments each group, with a comment commonly formulated by the whole team).

Breakdown of the points:

0.5p     - suggestions on how to improve the report content<br>
0.5p     - suggestions on how to improve the model<br>
0.5p     - general comments on the results and the code<br>
0.5p     - a question for the other team<br>

## Week 8 (W43)  - 21.10 – 28.10 – Final Submission
Breakdown of the points:

1p        - feedback incorporation and response to the commenting team<br>
1p        - code (correctness, efficiency, usability, accesability)<br>
1p        - reporting (readability, completeness, presentation)<br>
1p        - modelling correctness<br>
1p        - achieving the modelling goal<br>
